# # Face Recognition-Based Attendance System

## Introduction
This project is a face recognition-based attendance system designed to automate the process of taking attendance in various environments such as classrooms, offices, or events. By using facial recognition technology, this system eliminates the need for manual attendance marking and provides a more efficient and accurate way to track attendance.

## Features
- Automated attendance marking using facial recognition
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Support for multiple faces detection
- User-friendly interface for administrators and users
- Detailed attendance logs and reports

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- dlib
- Face recognition libraries (e.g., OpenFace, dlib's face recognition module)
- SQLite or MySQL for database management
- Flask (optional) for web-based interface

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
1. Run the main application:
